**👋🏽 Hey, I'm Bereket!**

I'm a developer based in Toronto, Canada who has a passion for AI and how it can change the future moving forward. I dabble in design and drawing so you can sometimes see me doing some things over on Figma, Sketch, and Adobe' tools. In the future, my plan is to start a tech startup to bring my love of coding and entrepreneurship together.

In my free time, you can catch me bike riding, walking, exploring, and talking to new people :) <br>
