**Hey, I'm Bereket! 👋🏽**

I'm a developer based in Toronto, Canada who has a passion to build things that impact people's day to day lives to make them better.

In the future, my plan is to start a tech startup to bring my love of coding and entrepreneurship together.
In my free time, you can catch me bike riding, walking, exploring, and talking to new people :) <br>
