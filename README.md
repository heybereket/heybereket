<h1><b>👋🏽 hi, im bereket━@bereketsemagn</b></h1>

I'm a software developer based in Toronto, ON. I'm passionate about artifical intelligence, open-source, and physics. I enjoy building web applications, websites, applications, apps, and everything in between. My everyday goal is to learn something, that can impact the world, through creativity, curiosity, and technology.

Besides coding and all, I also love to <a href="https://bereketsemagn.tk/blog">write</a>. <br>
***New writings come out whenever I feel like writing!***
