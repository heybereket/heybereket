<h1><b>👋🏽 hi, im bereket━@bereketsemagn</b></h1>

I'm a software developer based in Toronto, ON. I enjoy building web applications, it's websites, applications, apps, or anything in between. My everyday goal is to learn something, that can impact the world, through creativity, curiosity, and technology. I also love to <a href="https://bereketsemagn.tk/blog">write</a>.
