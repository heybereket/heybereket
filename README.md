**Hey, I'm Bereket! 👋🏽**

I'm a developer based in Toronto, Canada who has a passion to build things that impact people's day to day lives to make them better. Currently, I am interested in Typescript, Elixir, Rust, and building consumer social apps + developer tools.

In my free time, you can catch me bike riding, walking, exploring, and talking to new people :)
